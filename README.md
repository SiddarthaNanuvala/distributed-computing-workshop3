# Distributed Computing Workshop

This repository contains two workshops exploring distributed systems and redundancy in computing, implemented in Python.

## Overview
- **Part A: Decentralization TD3**: Focuses on distributed computing with predictive models, consensus, and slashing mechanisms.
- **Part B: E-commerce - Importance of Redundancy**: Implements an e-commerce API with synchronous mirroring and asynchronous replication for reliability.

## Structure
- **`Part_A/`**: Decentralized prediction system.
  - See `Part_A/README.md` for details.
- **`Part_B/`**: E-commerce API with redundancy.
  - See `Part_B/README.md` for details.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Git
